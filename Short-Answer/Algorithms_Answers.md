#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 
The last line is O(n^2) due to input multiplied to itself for output.
while loop is O(n^3) because n is multiplied three times to itself to change the marker for condition.
a = 0 is constant.

The answer is O(n^3) as that is the worst part of the code and like a bottle neck it will deminish performance.

b)
j *= 2  O(1) input does not effect this
sum += 1  O(1) input does not effect this
both of the above = O(2) = O(1) which is still a constant.
The while loop is O(n) as the condition is set on the n value no mater what. n has a linear relationship to the condition statement.
j = 1 is constant O(1)
range(n) is also constant as a Python operator.
sum = 0 is constant.

The answer is O(n) because the output is linear to the input.

c)
the first return is constant.
the if statement is constant.
the last return statement is O(n) because as the inputs increase, the output also increases linearly.
